# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
# Project Overview
Wee were tasked with tracking the number of employees who can retire based on birth date by using data bases and SQL. As another objective we were meant to make a table that shoes all employees who are eligable of the Mentorship Program at Pewlett Hackard.
## Deliverable 1

I created tables for the people retiring by title and also preformed a Distinct on to save a new table as unique titles. All csv's contain the information needed for each individual step. 

### Deliverable 2

With this deliverable we were asked to make a csv with the canidates who were eligable for the Mentorship Program. It must hold current employees born between January 1st, 1965 and December 31st, 1965.
